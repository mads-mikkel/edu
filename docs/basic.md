# C# Parsing and Conversion Exercises

You must use either Convert.ToX methods or the Parse method of a data type like this:

`int value = Convert.ToInt32("45");`

`int value = int.Parse("45");`

## string to int
Declare a string variable named ageAsString and assign it the value "30". Convert this string to an int and store the result in a new variable named age.

Declare a string variable named scoreAsString with the value "95". Use the int.Parse() method to convert it to an integer and save it in a variable called score.

Declare a string variable named yearString with the value "2025". Use the Convert.ToInt32() method to convert it and store the result in an int variable named year.

Declare a string variable named quantityString with the value "15". Convert it to an int and assign the value to a variable named quantity.

Declare a string variable named idString with the value "12345". Convert it to an int and save it to an int variable named id.

## string to double
Declare a string variable named priceAsString and assign it the value "19.99". Convert this string to a double and store the result in a new variable named price.
